# The AI-Powered SDLC: A Comprehensive Technical and Cultural Maturity Assessment Framework

In today's software development landscape, AI isn't just a feature we ship—it's becoming central to how we build, test, and deliver software. As organisations race to leverage AI's potential across the software development lifecycle (SDLC), a critical question emerges: "How do we measure maturity in AI adoption for development teams?"

I'm beginning to explore this question further, and have spent some time discussing it with Ryan Siikorsky, co-founder of Equal Experts, who was so influential in helping us develop the Defra AI SDLC Playbook—it continues to shape how we think about and approach AI delivery in practice.

We talked a lot about how we could measure AI maturity, and we looked at some of the 15-year-old Agile Maturity models. It made me think: Do we need an AI in the SDLC Maturity Assessment Framework to help organisations benchmark their current state and chart a path forward?
