## Scoring & Implementation

In line with the hierarchical compliance model, organisations must meet all criteria at a given level—as well as all levels below it—to attain that rating. For each dimension, the overall score will initially be determined by the highest level for which all requirements have been fully satisfied.

To implement this assessment effectively:
1. Establish a baseline assessment across all 17 dimensions
2. Conduct quarterly comprehensive reassessments to track progress
3. Implement monthly check-ins for high-priority dimensions (or for changing questions as this world is changing so fast)
4. Establish trigger-based unscheduled assessments for when significant AI advancements occur - give the team a win and let the organisation know
5. Automate data collection where possible to reduce assessment overhead - this again is something that could be done interesting with measuring key usage etc.
6. Link assessment results to specific, implementable improvements, and history of questions changing or new categories coming up as this world moves at the incredible pace it does
