## The Road Ahead: Beyond Maturity Assessment

While assessment is crucial, it's only valuable if it leads to tangible improvement. I would recommend approaching this as a transformation and a journey. Every organisation is unique in its goals, challenges and culture, and this context is key to shaping your path to AI maturity. Develop a tailored AI-SDLC roadmap with clear capabilities that you care about and make sense in the context of your organisation. It is not a race to get to the highest level, but a way to communicate where you are on the journey.

1. Identify cultural transformation needs alongside technical implementation
2. Benchmark against peers in your industry and other industries. I believe we are all learning and no one has the answer, and it is great if we can learn together
3. Set realistic adoption goals based on your current maturity level, do not be a fool with the tool :)

This framework is meant as a starting point, not an end state. As AI capabilities evolve at an unprecedented pace, our assessment approaches must evolve with them. I'd welcome your thoughts, experiences, and suggestions for improving this model or any other ideas you are trying and want to share. This is part of an ongoing thought process as we work to understand and measure our transformation journey at Defra. We will continue to iterate and update our Defra AI SDLC Playbook | Defra AI in the SDLC Playbook as our thinking and practice develops.
