## AI in User Research and Experience Analysis

This dimension assesses how AI enhances the gathering, analysis, and application of user insights throughout the development process.

Sample assessment questions for each level:
- Level -1 (Resistant): "Does the organization explicitly prohibit the use of AI tools for analyzing user behavior or feedback?"
- Level 0 (Ad-hoc): "Are AI user research tools used inconsistently by individual researchers without standards?"
- Level 1 (Exploratory): "Has the team identified specific user research activities that could benefit from AI assistance?"
- Level 2 (Structured): "Are AI tools used to categorize or tag user feedback in a systematic way?"
- Level 3 (Established): "Does AI analyze patterns across multiple user research sources (interviews, surveys, usage data)?"
- Level 4 (Integrated): "Is AI seamlessly integrated to detect emerging user needs not explicitly stated in feedback?"
- Level 5 (Transformative): "Does AI proactively identify new user opportunities and predict evolving user needs before they're articulated?"

Key metrics to track:
- Insight discovery efficiency: Reduction in time to extract meaningful insights from user research data
- Pattern recognition accuracy: Percentage of user behavior patterns correctly identified by AI
- Sentiment analysis precision: Accuracy of AI in determining user sentiment compared to human analysis
- Research synthesis speed: Time saved in synthesizing findings across multiple research sources
- Predictive user needs accuracy: Percentage of AI-predicted user needs that become validated requirements
- Research coverage expansion: Increase in volume and diversity of user feedback analyzed
- User insight implementation rate: Percentage of AI-identified insights that influence product decisions
