## Continuous Improvement Through AI Feedback Loops

Measures how AI insights drive systematic improvements across the entire development lifecycle.

Sample assessment questions for each level:
- Level -1: "Is there active resistance to using AI-generated insights for improvement?"
- Level 0: "Are AI insights used ad-hoc without formalised improvement processes?"
- Level 1: "Has the team identified areas where AI could enhance feedback loops?"
- Level 2: "Are basic AI analytics tools used to identify simple improvement opportunities?"
- Level 3: "Are user telemetry or product usage logs used to refine features via AI?"
- Level 4: "Are AI-driven insights discussed during sprint planning?"
- Level 5: "Is AI embedded in continuous discovery to identify future product directions?"

Key metrics to track:
- Insight-to-action velocity: Time from AI-generated insight to implemented improvement
- Feature optimisation impact: User engagement improvement after AI-suggested refinements
- Process adaptation frequency: Number of process improvements driven by AI insights
- Predictive trend accuracy: Percentage of AI-predicted trends that materialise
- Innovation acceleration: Reduction in time from idea to validated concept with AI assistance
