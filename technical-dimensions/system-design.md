## AI in System Design

Evaluates how AI supports architecture decisions, design trade-offs, and technical documentation.

Sample assessment questions for each level:
- Level -1: "Are AI-generated design suggestions explicitly rejected without consideration?"
- Level 0: "Are AI design tools used on an ad-hoc basis by individual architects?"
- Level 1: "Has the team identified specific design activities that could benefit from AI?"
- Level 2: "Are AI tools used to validate basic design patterns or decisions?"
- Level 3: "Does AI assist in generating or validating system architecture?"
- Level 4: "Are design trade-offs assessed using AI simulations or analysis?"
- Level 5: "Is generative AI used for rapid prototyping of design alternatives?"

Key metrics to track:
- Design alternatives explored: Number of AI-generated design options considered
- Architecture validation efficacy: Percentage of issues detected by AI before implementation
- Design documentation completeness: Measured through structured evaluation after AI assistance
- Performance optimisation: Percentage improvement in key metrics after AI-suggested optimisations
- Design iteration velocity: Reduction in time required for design refinement cycles with AI
