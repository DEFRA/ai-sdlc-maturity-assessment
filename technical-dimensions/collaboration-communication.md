Sample assessment questions for each level:
- Level -1: "Are AI collaboration tools explicitly prohibited in team communications?"

- Level 4: "Do AI bots assist in real-time knowledge retrieval from documentation?"
- Level 5: "Are virtual agents used to coordinate actions across toolchains?"

Key metrics to track:
- Information accessibility: Reduction in time spent searching for project information
- Meeting efficiency: Percentage reduction in meeting time with AI-assisted summaries
- Knowledge transfer effectiveness: Improvement in cross-team knowledge sharing
- Decision documentation completeness: Quality of AI-captured decisions and rationales
- Communication clarity: Measured improvement in team alignment after AI assistance
