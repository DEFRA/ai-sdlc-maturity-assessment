## The AI-SDLC Maturity Assessment Framework

This assessment adapts the Agile Maturity Model structure with nine technical dimensions and three cultural dimensions, using a 7-level rating scale:

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| -1 | Resistant | Inhibits AI/SDLC practices; presence of anti-patterns |
| 0 | Adhoc | Ad-hoc, undisciplined practices; reliant on individuals |
| 1 | Exploratory | Basic AI practices exist; no integration |
| 2 | Structured | AI adoption is intentional and supports process improvement |
| 3 | Established | Process-driven, consistent application across teams |
| 4 | Integrated | AI practices are intuitive, evolving, and culturally ingrained |
| 5 | Transformative | AI innovation is systemic; the process adapts fluidly to context |

Unlike annual assessments typical of traditional models, AI maturity should be reassessed quarterly with monthly check-ins for high-priority initiatives due to the rapid evolution of AI capabilities. The cadence should be tailored based on your current maturity level, with early-stage organisations potentially requiring more frequent evaluations.
