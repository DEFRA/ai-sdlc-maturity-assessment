## Why Another Maturity Model?

Traditional software maturity models focus on process standardisation and documentation, which are essential aspects, but insufficient for measuring AI-augmented development practices. AI adoption in software teams is uniquely challenging because:

1. It's moving incredibly fast - What was cutting-edge six months ago may now be table stakes
2. It's transformative, not incremental - AI doesn't just optimise existing processes; it fundamentally changes how work gets done.
3. It requires cultural transformation - Success depends as much on the team's willingness and adaptability as on technological implementation.

Research shows that the most significant barriers to AI adoption in software development are cultural and organisational, not technical. Organisations with strong cultural readiness for AI, we believe, will be better at adopting these frameworks when implementing AI solutions.
