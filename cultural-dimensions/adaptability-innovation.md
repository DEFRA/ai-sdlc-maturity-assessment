## Adaptability and Innovation Culture

Organisations with strong adaptability should show way more operating and financial benefits over three years when implementing AI solutions.

Sample assessment questions for each level:
- Level -1: "Does the organisation actively discourage experimentation with new AI technologies?"
- Level 0: "Does AI experimentation happen informally without organisational support?"
- Level 1: "Has the organisation recognised the value of innovation culture for AI adoption?"
- Level 2: "Are teams allocated dedicated time for exploring AI in their domains?"
- Level 3: "Is there a formal process for conducting and evaluating AI experiments?"
- Level 4: "Is failure treated as a valuable learning opportunity in AI initiatives?"
- Level 5: "Is continuous experimentation with AI embedded in organisational identity?"

Key metrics to track:
- Innovation adoption rate: Percentage of employees proactively adopting new tools
- Psychological safety score: Structured assessment of team environments
- Experiment frequency: Number of AI-related experiments conducted quarterly
- Failure tolerance: Ratio of acknowledged "valuable failures" to successful projects
- Knowledge sharing index: Frequency of cross-team learning about AI initiatives
